# PROJECT 3 US Chronic Diseases
See ReadMe section

## Topic
CDC's Division of Population Health provides a cross-cutting set of 115 indicators developed by consensus among CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. These indicators allow states and territories to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice in their area. In addition to providing access to state-specific indicator data, the CDI web site serves as a gateway to additional information and data resources.
